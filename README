This is a small pseudo-IRC bridge that's used in a very hacky implementation
of a website version of PINKSERV2.

The basic architecture is this:
	your computer makes a web request to the "api"
	lighttpd forwards to a flask server run in a bash while loop
	the python code runs a dummy IRC client connecting to localhost (this)
	(this) the dummy IRC server on localhost bridges the gap to PINKSERV2
	the python sends the equivalent of a PRIVMSG to PINKSERV2
	PINKSERV2 is connected to the local IRC server (this) in the same way it
		connects to any IRC server, so it sees the PRIVMSG
	PINKSERV2 responds to the message
	the local IRC server (this) sends the message back to the python code
	the python code waits for the response and reads it (or aborts if it takes
		too long, assuming no output was generated)
	the response is converted into an image (because reasons) and output
	the response is routed back up the server chain to your browser

Hacks upon hacks. The good bit is that it was very quick to setup. The bad bit
is literally every single other part.
